# Raid Frame Nicknames
## Summary
**Raid Frame Nicknames** allows you to define a nickname for a character that will appear on their unit frame when they are in your party or raid. Multiple characters can be associated to a single nickname, so you can always tell which altoholic friend you're grouped up with regardless of what character they are playing on!

## Important Notes
- A nickname will only appear for party members when you have the **Raid-Style Party Frames** option enabled
- This AddOn is built to work with default Blizzard raid frames, so it may cause unexpected interactions if you are running any other AddOns that modify names on unit frames

## Usage
You can use the options window to modify all available options. To open the options window from the Chat window, type the slash command `/rfn config`.

### Options Window
- **Debug**: Display debugging messages in the default chat window (You should never need to enable this)

#### Add New Entry
- **Nickname**: A new nickname that you want to see in your raid frames
- **Character Name**: A character to assign the nickname to

#### Current Nicknames
Options defined below are available for each existing nickname. The **Delete Nickname** button deletes the chosen nickname along with all associated characters. Characters associated with a nickname are listed in this section, with a **Delete** button allowing you to disassociate a character name with the chosen nickname.
- **Add to Nickname**: Adds a new character to associate with the chosen nickname

### Slash Commands
- `rfn config`: Opens the Options window
- `rfn debug`: Toggles debug messages in the default chat window
  - This is the same as clicking the **Debug** checkbox in the Options window
